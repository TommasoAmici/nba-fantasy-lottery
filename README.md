# NbaLottery

This is a very simple website I used to simulate the lottery draft in my
NBA fantasy league. It is also the first non-tutorial Phoenix app I write.

The teams are hard coded, the lottery odds are hard coded, but using a GenServer
the state of the draft is shared across clients.

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
